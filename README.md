## Setup
The project has been scaled down somewhat from it's intended functionality. This is a database oriented program that can track the information and location status of students, and enable them to sign in and out of a decentralized database. Complete setup instructions are coming soon and will be updated here.
GUI-Test-6 is the most up-to-date version as of 11/1/21.
