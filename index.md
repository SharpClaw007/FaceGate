**NOTICE: FaceGate is under active development for the time being; updates will be pushed regularly to this repository. Expected v1.0 release date around Q3 2021. FaceGate is designed for primarily educational environments, so terminology such as "students", "teachers", and "administration" may be used. However, the FaceGate system is not exclusive to this application, and can be modified to suit the needs of the end-user.**

## OVERVIEW

FaceGate is a visual identification and tracking solution that aims to bring cutting edge technology to end-user applications within professional working environments. FaceGate not only automates previously manual tasks, but provides digital backups to valuable surveillance data while enabling enterprise-level scaling for variable applications. 

## GOALS

* Enable the visual identification and tracking of users through machine learning algorithms.

* Automate logging and general entry tasks to external servers.

## SPECIFICATIONS

FaceGate systems are highly customizable to fit the needs of the end user, but each solution consists of 3 standard components:

1. Central PC to process sensor data, as well as push logs and visual records to a centralized database.
2. Camera to capture visual data, which is pushed to the central PC for further processing.
3. Small device manager that takes instructions from the central PC, and can perform tasks such as opening and closing entryways, prompting users for more information, etc.
4. Internal/External database that pulls logging/tracking information, which can be accesssed by authorized administrators in a clean and understandable format.
